# Data Analysis for Seoul BikeSharing Sercive
### Abstract
Today, rental bikes are offered in a wide range of urban cities to enhance comfortableness and 
environmental sustainability. Availability and accessibility of rental bikes to the public are two 
important aspects of a successful bike-sharing scheme. In order to have a stable supply of rental bikes 
and reduce waiting time, it is essential to make a prediction for future rental bike demand. This project 
first discusses an exploratory data analysis for hourly rental bike demand in Seoul based on different 
predictors such as weather information and time and explores the distribution characteristic of 
temperature and wind speed data. Moreover, two statistical regression models, linear regression and 
gradient boosting machine, were developed and their performances were evaluated with three 
evaluation indices on training and test sets. Features importance is explained for both methods and the 
cross-validation method is used to find the best hyperparameters for the gradient boosting and linear 
regression algorithms. The gradient boosting machine with optimized parameters can give the best 
results with an ùëÖ^2 value of 0.94 on the training set and 0.87 on the test set
